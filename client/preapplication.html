				Every year, we recognize that our hackers have a diverse set of goals coming into our event. 
				This year we are introducing two tracks with focused resources to target those goals: 
				<strong>Emerging Track and General Track</strong>. We have designed resources specifically for the audiences 
				they would be most effective for but all resources are available to everyone.

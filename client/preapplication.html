			<p>Every year, we recognize that our hackers have a diverse set of goals coming into our event. 
				This year we are introducing two tracks with focused resources to target those goals: 
				<strong>Emerging Track and General Track</strong>. We have designed resources specifically for the audiences 
				they would be most effective for but all resources are available to everyone.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Emerging: </strong>New to hackathons and unsure of how to start building a technology project? 
				The Emerging Hacker Track is here to provide you with guidance into introductory technology and how to 
				ace a hackathon. Part of this track is a mentorship matching program to help guide you and your team 
				through your first hackathon project. We will be offering workshops in Introductory App Development, 
				Web Development, Data Science, and Gaming & Graphics designed for you (but open for everyone at the event!) to 
				learn the fundamentals and get you started on your dream hackathon project!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>General: </strong>**Already know the drill and feel comfortable building a technology project? 
				The General Hacker Track is the conventional hacker experience, giving you full creative control and 
				offering supplemental resources as necessary.** This track is here to give you opportunities to innovate 
				and connect with others; we have set up a speaker series to expose you to industry professionals and new 
				technologies to help you take your project to the next level.
